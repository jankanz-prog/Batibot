Project Description: Blockchain-Based Voting System

The Blockchain-Based Voting System is a decentralized web application that enables secure, transparent, and tamper-proof elections. By leveraging blockchain technology, the system ensures that every vote is recorded immutably, preventing manipulation or deletion.

The project is built with a React.js + Vite frontend that provides a fast, responsive, and modern interface for voters and administrators. Users can easily cast votes through an interactive web form and view real-time results with dynamic charts. The backend (implemented with Spring Boot or Node.js) acts as an API layer, handling authentication, vote submissions, and communication with the blockchain via Web3.js or Web3j.

A Solidity smart contract deployed on Ethereum (testnet or local blockchain like Ganache/Hardhat) manages the core election logic. The contract securely stores votes, prevents double voting, and ensures transparency. Results are retrieved directly from the blockchain and displayed in the React frontend.

Key Features
