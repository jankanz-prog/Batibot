# 🔗 Decentralized Gamified Trading Platform

## 📖 Overview  
This project is a **blockchain-based trading system** that combines secure digital asset ownership with gamified mechanics. Users can acquire items, trade securely via smart contracts, manage their inventory, and interact socially within a decentralized marketplace.  

The system introduces **automatic item drops**, rarity-based assets, and crafting mechanics to keep users engaged, while ensuring transparency and fairness through blockchain technology.

## ✨ Features  
- **Wallet Integration** – Manage tokens and assets securely.  
- **Item Acquisition** – Receive items automatically (e.g., every 1 minute) with rarity levels.  
- **Inventory Management** – Organize and track owned assets.  
- **Secure Trading** – Peer-to-peer trades powered by smart contracts.  
- **Marketplace & Auctions** – List items for sale or bidding.  
- **Crafting System** – Combine items to create stronger or rarer ones.  
- **Chat System** – Real-time messaging between traders.  
- **Notifications** – Alerts for trades, new items, and offers.  
- **Leaderboards & Missions** – Gamified challenges to boost engagement.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack  
- **Blockchain:** Ethereum / Polygon / BNB Smart Chain (EVM-compatible)  
- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity  
- **Frontend:** React.js + Vite  
- **Backend (optional):** Node.js / Spring Boot  
- **Storage:** IPFS/Arweave (item metadata), SQL/NoSQL (non-critical data)

## 🎮 How It Works  
1. Users connect their blockchain wallet.  
2. Every minute, new items are dropped and stored in the user’s inventory.  
3. Users can trade items securely through smart contracts or list them on the marketplace.  
4. Crafting allows combining items to generate rarer assets.  
5. Chat, notifications, and leaderboards keep the experience interactive and social.
