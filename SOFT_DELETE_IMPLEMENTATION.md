# 🗑️ Soft Delete Implementation for Inventory System

## ✅ Implementation Complete

### 📋 Overview
Implemented a soft-delete system for inventory items that allows users to "delete" items without permanently removing them from the database. Items can be restored if the user changes their mind, and the 30-item limit only counts active (non-deleted) items.

---

## 🔧 Backend Changes

### 1. **Inventory Model** (`models/inventoryModel.js`)
Added `is_deleted` field:
```javascript
is_deleted: {
    type: DataTypes.BOOLEAN,
    allowNull: false,
    defaultValue: false,
    comment: 'Soft delete flag - true means item is in deleted items section'
}
```

### 2. **Inventory Controller** (`controllers/inventoryController.js`)
**Updated Functions:**
- `getInventory()` - Now filters by `is_deleted = false` by default
- `addItemToInventory()` - Only counts non-deleted items for 30-item limit

**New Functions:**
- `softDeleteItem()` - Marks item as deleted (`is_deleted = true`)
- `restoreItem()` - Restores deleted item (checks 30-item limit first)
- `getDeletedItems()` - Fetches all items where `is_deleted = true`

### 3. **Routes** (`routes/authRoutes.js`)
Added new endpoints:
```javascript
router.post('/inventory/soft-delete', authenticateToken, softDeleteItem);
router.post('/inventory/restore', authenticateToken, restoreItem);
router.get('/inventory/deleted', authenticateToken, getDeletedItems);
```

### 4. **Item Generation Service** (`app.js`)
Temporarily disabled automatic item generation (commented out lines 230-238)

---

## 🎨 Frontend Changes

### 1. **API Service** (`services/itemsAPI.ts`)
Added new API functions:
```typescript
softDeleteItem(item_id, token)  // Move item to deleted
restoreItem(item_id, token)     // Restore deleted item
getDeletedItems(token)          // Get all deleted items
```

### 2. **InventoryPage Component** (`components/InventoryPage.tsx`)
**New Features:**
- Toggle button to switch between Active Items and Deleted Items views
- Delete button (🗑️) on each active item
- Restore button (↩️) on each deleted item
- Loads both active and deleted items simultaneously
- Shows count of deleted items in toggle button

**New State:**
```typescript
const [deletedItems, setDeletedItems] = useState<InventoryItem[]>([]);
const [showDeleted, setShowDeleted] = useState(false);
```

**New Functions:**
- `handleSoftDelete(item_id)` - Soft deletes an item
- `handleRestore(item_id)` - Restores a deleted item

### 3. **Styles** (`styles/items.css`)
**New Styles:**
- `.delete-btn` - Red gradient delete button
- `.restore-btn` - Green gradient restore button
- `.deleted-item` - Dashed border with striped background for deleted items
- `.item-actions` - Container for action buttons
- `.header-actions` - Container for header buttons

**Grid Layout:**
- Changed from `auto-fill` to fixed `5 columns` (6x5 grid)
- Responsive breakpoints:
  - Mobile: 1 column
  - Tablet (769px-1024px): 3 columns
  - Desktop (1025px+): 5 columns

## 🎯 User Experience

### Active Inventory View
- Shows only non-deleted items
- Each item has a "🗑️ Delete" button
- 30-item limit only counts these items
- Stats show accurate counts

### Deleted Items View
- Toggle with "🗑️ Deleted Items (X)" button
- Shows all soft-deleted items with dashed borders
- Each item has a "↩️ Restore" button
- Cannot restore if active inventory is full (30/30)

### Visual Feedback
- Deleted items have:
  - 70% opacity
  - Dashed border
  - Striped background pattern
  - Hover effect increases opacity to 100%

## 🔐 Security & Validation

### Backend Validation
- ✅ Only item owner can delete/restore their items
- ✅ Checks inventory limit before restoring
- ✅ Validates item exists before operations
- ✅ Proper error messages for all scenarios

### Frontend Validation
- ✅ Requires authentication token
- ✅ Handles errors gracefully
- ✅ Reloads inventory after operations
- ✅ Shows loading states

## 📊 Database Impact

### Before
```sql
SELECT * FROM inventories WHERE user_id = 1;
-- Returns all items (active + deleted)
```

### After
```sql
-- Active items only (default)
SELECT * FROM inventories WHERE user_id = 1 AND is_deleted = false;

-- Deleted items
SELECT * FROM inventories WHERE user_id = 1 AND is_deleted = true;

-- Count for 30-item limit
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM inventories WHERE user_id = 1 AND is_deleted = false;
```
